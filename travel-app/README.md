## Instructions

To view the page open terminal and point to project root folder ` cd /travel-app` then run `node server.js`. In your browser open [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/) and start testing out the app's functionality.

## Goals

The travel-app made use of asynchronous functions to take user city input and make requests to the Geonames, Weatherbit, and Pixabay APIs. The UI is dynamically updated based on the responses from the external APIs and user input data.
