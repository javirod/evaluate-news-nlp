## Instructions

To view the Landing Page open `index.html` in your browser and start testing out the app's functionality.

## Goals

The Landing Page project was converted from a static version to a dynamic version throught the addition of JavaScript code and manipulation of existing CSS and HTML.

## Challenges

Looping through the all of the `<sections>` was initially challenging since it was assumed that an unknown amount of sections could be added.

I also had some issues initially keeping variables in the correct scope, but eventually ended up figuring out which needed to be maintained within the scope of the block.

## Future Work

Some additional work I would like to update the Landing Page project when i get more time: 

* Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
* Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
* Make sections collapsible.
